# Concepts

Civic Lab’s technical architecture follows a few core principles:

- Strong object boundaries (dossiers, artifacts, RFCs, findings).
- Explicit lanes and claim resolution to keep reasoning testable.
- Auditable change control via RFCs and revision sets.

This page will expand into a full concept map and glossary.
